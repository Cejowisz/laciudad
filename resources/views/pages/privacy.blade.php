                <h5>OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND SECURITY PLEDGE</h5>
                <p>
                    laciudadgroup.com treats the privacy of our visitors with the highest importance. This policy details
                    the measures we take to preserving and safely guarding your privacy when you visit or
                    communicate with our site or personnel. Your satisfaction with this website is important to us.
                    Assuring the privacy and security of all of the information you share with us on this website is an
                    important part of that satisfaction. We want to be open and clear with regard to how we handle
                    your personal information. Please find our policies listed below. If you have any questions
                    regarding these policies, we invite you to email us at infor@laciudadgroup.com.
                    Thank you for visiting laciudadgroup.com!<br/><br/>

                <h5>PROTECTING YOUR INFORMATION</h5>
                <p>
                    laciudadgroup.com uses a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts ALL of the
                    information you provide to us, including your name, address and credit card number, before it is
                    sent to us so that it cannot be read as it travels to us over the internet. Once we receive it, all of
                    the customer information we collect is protected against unauthorized access.<br/><br/>
                    We do this by following these following steps:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Firewall – laciudadgroup.com’s systems are protected 24 hours a day by a powerful firewall that
                    blocks unauthorized entry. In order to gain access to authorized information, the web browser
                    you are using must know the proper protocol, or language
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Encryption – From the moment information leaves your computer to the time is enters our
                    systems, all online access is encrypted. We employ some of the strongest forms of encryption
                    commercially available for use on the Web today. During any transfer of data, our 128-bit
                    encryption turns your information into a coded sequence with billions of possible variations,
                    making it nearly impossible for unwanted intruders to decipher.

                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Password protected- Your laciudadgroup.com account is password protected. Timed log-off
                    laciudadgroup.com’s system will automatically log you off from our site after 30 minutes of inactivity.
                    This reduces the risk of others accessing your information from your unattended computer
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Employee access – We limit employee access to customer information to those who have a
                    business reason to know this information. Although we intend to take all reasonable steps to
                    prevent the introduction of viruses and other destructive materials or hackers, we cannot and do
                    not guarantee or warrant that this website, or materials that may be downloaded from this
                    website, do not contain such destructive features. We are not liable for any damages or harm
                    attributable to any of the foregoing. laciudadgroup.com may share any of your information with
                    companies that provide services to us, including companies that operate outside of Nigeria.
                    laciudadgroup.com does not share your personal information with any outside companies or vendors,
                    however any nonaffiliated companies that act on our behalf and receive personal information
                    from us are contractually obligated to keep the information we provide to them confidential.
